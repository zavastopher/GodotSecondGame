# GodotSecondGame
My Second Ever Godot Game

In this tutorial I made a simple platformer with a menu and scene transitions. I designed the platform levels
on my own using the assets provided by the tutorial. I did my best to avoid following the tutorial beat  for 
beat and worked ahead and debugged my game on my own.

What I learned:
How to design simple platform levels.
Scene transitions.
Tile Mapping.
TileSet Collisions.
Gravity Manipulation in Gadot.
